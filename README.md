# my-first-open-source-project

My first open source project, was created because I was struggling to find Beginner level open source PR's I could contribute to. I also wanted to create a platform to aggregate and share information for people who want to learn to code, but may not be a part of a community by:

* Listing online coding resources
* Allow filtering based on the following criteria: language, cost & learning style
* Offer practical tips on how to get started
* Crowd source knowledge from others
* Offer guidance on how to best showcase development skills you've learnt online to get a job in tech
* Foster an online community of learners & support
* Link to other useful resources, such as meetups etc
